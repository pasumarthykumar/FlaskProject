1.Flask:

Flask is a Python web framework designed for building web applications. It simplifies web development by providing tools and libraries for tasks like routing, handling requests and responses.

2.SQLAlchemy:

SQLAlchemy is a widely-used Python library, known as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. It simplifies interactions with relational databases by offering a high-level, database-agnostic interface.

3.sqlalchemy.text:

This code imports the text function from SQLAlchemy. It's used for crafting SQL queries in a textual format, which can be executed as raw SQL statements when necessary.

4.jsonify:

Jsonify is a Flask function that converts Python dictionaries and data structures into JSON responses. These JSON responses are sent back as part of HTTP responses.

5.abort:

The abort function is used in Flask to generate HTTP error responses with specific status codes, making it easier to handle errors during web application requests.

6.request:

The request object, provided by Flask, represents the incoming HTTP request. It's a versatile tool for accessing various aspects of the request, such as form data and query parameters.

7.werkzeug.exceptions.NotFound:

This package includes the NotFound exception, which is used to create HTTP 404 (Not Found) error responses. It's part of the Werkzeug library that Flask is built upon.

8.Flask JWT Extended (flask_jwt_extended):

Flask JWT Extended is an extension for Flask, specifically designed to simplify JSON Web Token (JWT) management. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

9.JWTManager:

JWTManager is a class provided by Flask JWT Extended that enables the configuration and management of JWT settings, making it easier to implement JWT-based authentication.

10.create_access_token:

This function, offered by Flask JWT Extended, is used to generate new JWT access tokens. These tokens are crucial for secure user authentication.

11.jwt_required:

The jwt_required decorator, part of Flask JWT Extended, adds an extra layer of security to routes by requiring a valid JWT token for access. This helps protect sensitive areas of a web application.

12.get_jwt_identity:

The get_jwt_identity function, integrated with Flask JWT Extended, allows developers to retrieve the identity, often the user's username, stored within a valid JWT token.
